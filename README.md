# Data-Interpretaion-using-Statistical-Models-using-Python
This Exercise is inspired by "Interpreting Data Using Statistical Models with Python" By Janani Ravi
It covers visualizations and basic descriptive statistics by harnessing the power of inferential statistics. It shows how hypothesis testing, which is the foundation of inferential statistics, helps postulate and test assumptions made about data.It covers classic t-test which can be used in a variety of common scenarios around estimating means. It demonstrates tests such as the Z-test, Pearson's chi-squared test, Levene's test, and Welch's t-test for dealing with populations that have unequal variances. Finally, it demonstrates ANOVA, a powerful statistical technique used to measure means across different categories of data.
